# **"Exploring Global Culinary Diversity"** 
## **A Network Analysis of Ingredients and Countries**
In this notebook, we will explore network analysis applied to a dataset of cooking recipes. The goal of this analysis is to discover patterns and relationships in the ingredients and countries of origin of the recipes.

In particular, we will use tools such as Gephi and NetworkX to create visualizations of the network of ingredients and countries and to calculate measures of centrality and modularity in the network.

**Let's get started on the recipe, ingredient, and country network analysis!**
